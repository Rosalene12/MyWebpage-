                    Describing myself is one of the toughest tasks to do, but it’s fascinating too, to put it to words.
                    I believe our traits – be they positive or negative – make us the person we are to the world.
                    When it comes to my personality, people can have different opinions because they see what they want to see in me, and that’s okay.
                    So, I would describe myself from the paradigm I see myself from in different aspects.
                    As a person, I believe life is an art, and I am the artist of my life.
                    I try to keep it full of colors and as cheerful as possible no matter what life throws at me.
                    I am an enthusiast and a person full of curiosity. Curious to know what life is all about and what it holds in the future.
                    I like to keep a smile on my face no matter what I am going through, and that smile keeps me going.
                    I am an extrovert, and I like to meet people, I love to experience their lives, cultures, and traditions, which makes me happy and cheerful.
                    This is me, trying to contemplate the world as it is, revealing its true colors.
                    I believe life is a gift, and it should be treated like one, with love, care, and respect.
